== Getting Started

In this chapter We will look how to create an storm project and We will create 

our first storm topologie

TIP: All of the following assume that you have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed at least in their version 1.6, our recommendation is to use one provided by Oracle, which can be found at (link:www.java.com/downloads/)

=== Operation Modes

Before start, It is important to know about the _Storm operations modes_ this It is the name that receive the two storm running ways

==== Local Mode

In this mode all the storm topologie runs in your local machine, this mode It is excelent for develope and test your topologie because you be able to see how your topologie is running and you can debug It, also you can change different parameters that enable you how your topologie runs in differents cluster configuration environments, We will see more about that later (<<testing_our_topologie, Testing our topologie>>)

In all examples chapter We will work in the *Local Mode* 

==== Remote Mode

In the remote mode you will use your computer to submIt your topologie to the Storm cluster, so this will run in really distribute mode across your cluster, We can considerate the remote mode as the *Production Mode* because ever you will run storm in production you will use this mode hoWever It is possible run your topologie in remote mode into development enviroment (and It's recommendable to do that), We will how to do It later (<<testing_our_topologie, Testing our topologie>>)

We will see more about the *Remote Mode* in the chapter <<A Real Life Example>>
