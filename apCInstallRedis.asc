== Apendix A: Install Redis

=== Installing redis

Installing redis is very easy. We just need to follow the next steps:

* Download the lastest stable version from the redis site (link:http://redis.io/download[]) at this moment the lastest version is *2.4.14*

* When we've downloaded the version, we should extract it,

* The next step is to run +make+ followed by +make install+

This will compile redis and leave executable files in out PATH so we can start using redis.

You'll find more information on the redis official site, as well as documentation on commands and design considerations.
