== Apendix A: Install Storm Client

Install the storm client will enable us to use the commands to manage topologies into a cluster

The first thing to do is download the lastest stable version from the site (link:https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm/downloads[]) at this moment the lastest version is *storm-0.6.2*

When we've downloaded the version, we should unzip it and add the uncompressed folder plus /bin (PATH_TO_FOLDER/storm-0.6.2/bin) to our *PATH* environment variable and make executable *bin/storm*

After that we need to create an storm local configuration where we'll say which is our nimbus host to do it we'll create a file in *~/.storm/storm.yaml* with the next content:

----
nimbus.host: "our nimbus address"
----

Now, we are availables to submit topologies to our cluster and kill this running *storm jar* and *storm kill* respectively
