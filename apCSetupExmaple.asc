== Real Life Example Setup

=== Cloning the repository

GitHub repository for the example is:

----
> git clone git://github.com/storm-book/examples-ch06-real-life-app.git
----

==== Source Organization

The *src/main* directory contains the *Topology* soruce code.
The *src/test* directory has the tests for the *Topology*
The *webapps* directory has the Node.Js WebApp to play with the *Topology*.

=== Installing Redis

Installing redis is very easy. We just need to follow the next steps:

* Download the lastest stable version from the redis site (link:http://redis.io/download[]) at this moment the lastest version is *2.4.14*

* When we've downloaded the version, we should extract it,

* The next step is to run +make+ followed by +make install+

This will compile redis and leave executable files in out PATH so we can start using redis.

You'll find more information on the redis official site, as well as documentation on commands and design considerations.


=== Installing NodeJS

Installing nodejs is pretty straightforward. Download latest nodejs sources from the official site (link:http://www.nodejs.org/#download[]).

At this moment the latest version of NodeJS is *0.6.19*. Extract the content of the file and run +./configure+, +make+ and +make install+.

You'll find more information on the official site, as well as documentation on how to install NodeJS on different platforms.


=== Building and Testing

In order to build the example you should first start the *redis-server* in your machine, in order for the tests to run.

----
>nohup redis-server &
----

After that, you can run the *mvn* command to effectively compile and test the application.

----
>mvn package
...

=== Running The Topology

Once the *redis-server* is running and the build is successful you can start the topology running in a *LocalCluster*.

----
>java -jar target/storm-analytics-0.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar 
----

After the topology is started you can start the *Node.JS Web Application* by running this:

----
>node webapp/app.js 
----

TIP: Topology and Node.JS commands will be blocking, we suggest you to run them in different terminals.
