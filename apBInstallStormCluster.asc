== Apendix B: Install Storm Cluster

If we want create an storm cluster we haver two ways to do it

* Use *link:https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm-deploy[storm-deploy]* to create a cluster on amazon EC2 as we saw in <<a_real_life_example,Chapter 6>>
* Install storm manualy (the way that we'll see in this apendix)

To install storm manualy we should to have installed: 

* Zookeeper cluster: we can check how to do it in their link:http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.3.3/zookeeperAdmin.html[Administration Guide]

* Java 6

* Python 2.6.6

* Unzip command 

CAUTION: All the next steps and the java, python and unzip command will be requiered in nimbus and supervisor process

When we've this requirements we'll install the native libraries 

To install ZeroMQ we'll run:
----
    wget http://download.zeromq.org/historic/zeromq-2.1.7.tar.gz
    tar -xzf zeromq-2.1.7.tar.gz
    cd zeromq-2.1.7
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install
----

To install JZMQ we'll run 
----
    git clone https://github.com/nathanmarz/jzmq.git
    cd jzmq
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install
----

Ones we have installed the native libraries we'll download the lastest storm stable version (storm-0.7.1 at write book time) from their download site and unzip it.

The next step is modify the configuration file to add our storm cluster configuration (we can see all defaults configurations on link:https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm/blob/master/conf/defaults.yaml[defaults.yaml] into the storm repository)

To modify the storm cluster configuration we'll need to edit the conf/storm.yaml file located into the storm folder and set (as least) the next parameters:

----
storm.zookeeper.servers:
  - "zookeeper addres 1"
  - "zookeeper addres 2"
  - "zookeeper addres N"

storm.local.dir: "a local directory"

nimbus.host: "Numbus host addres" 

supervisor.slots.ports:
    - supervisor slot port 1 
    - supervisor slot port 2 
    - supervisor slot port N 

----

This parameters are:

* *storm.zookeeper.servers*: the address of our zookeeper servers

* *storm.local.dir*: a local directory where the storm process will store internal data (It's very important that the user who runs the storm process has write acces over this directory)

* *nimbus.host*: the addres of the machine where the nimbus will run

* *supervisor.slots.ports*: these are the ports (normally starting on 6700) that the workers use for receiving messages, the supervisor will run one worker per port declared into this property

When we've configured this parameters we are available to run the all the storm process, if we want to do local test we can configure *nimbus.host* to localhost

To start one process we should run into the storm folder: *./bin/storm* _process name_

TIP: Storm comes with an excelent utility called *storm ui* which enable us to monitor our topologies
