=== Technologies involved
In this chapter we will use several technologies:
==== Amazon EC2:
Amazon EC2 is a service and a set of APIs that allows us to create servers in an on-demand basis and you pay just for the time you use. If you want to follo
w the examples in this chapter easily. We strongly recommend you to create your Amazon EC2 account at: http://aws.amazon.com
==== Node.JS:Node.JS is a JavasCript based library which runs on top of the Google's V2. It's event oriented and ideal for IO intensive webservers development. The reaso
n for that is that it doesn't use threads to wait for multiple blocking IO operations. For mor information pleae go to the project's website at: http://node
js.org
==== Storm Deploy:
Storm deploy is a framework also created by Nathan Marz. It's objective is to create a Storm cluster from the scratch and configure it using Amazon EC2. The
 project GitHub page is: https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm-deploy
==== Apache Maven:
Maven is a Java build tool. It's purpouse is to automate the building process. It also solves the library dependencies resolution and download. The Apache M
aven Home Page is: http://maven.apache.org/

==== GitHub:
GitHub is a social coding platform. The search engine source code is hosted in the git service that GitHub provides.
=== How to work with this example:
For this example to run properly, many tools need to be installed and configured. To make it easier for you, we've prepared an Amazon Image (AMI) so you can
 create an instance using your account and will have all the required software installed.

==== Creating your account in the Amazon Web Services environment

- If you are an AWS user you can skip this step and advance to "Creating an instance".
- Enter to the AWS Home Page: http://aws.amazon.com

- Click in the Sign Up button:
- If you previously had an Amazon.com account, you can use it. If you are not, you must enter your email and proactively click the "I am a new user" option:

==== Creating an instance:

TIP: You will probably be charged for the use of this instance.
